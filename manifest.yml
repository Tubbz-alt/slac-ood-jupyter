  This [app] will launch a customizable [Jupyter] server on our cluster and automatically present its interface on this webpage.
  You are free to create your own instances in [Conda]/[Singularity] etc on our clusters.

  Due to issues of AFS tokens, you will need to ask Yee to create a new 'jupyter' home directory for you before using this. You will then also need to run the following script to create symlinks from your AFS home directory. 
  ```sh /gpfs/slac/staas/fs1/g/jupyter/ood/convert.sh```
